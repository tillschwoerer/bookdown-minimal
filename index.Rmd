# Intro

This is a minimal reproducible example related to [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61204682/how-can-i-use-paged-printing-of-data-frames-in-bookdown-when-markdown-files-are).

If `new_session: no` (the default) is set in the file _bookdown.yml, then data frames are printed with paging (the desired format). However, if we set `new_session: yes`, then paging is not applied. Any help on how to achieve paging under these circumstances is appreciated.

["index.html", "Paged printing of data frames in bookdown 1 Intro", " Paged printing of data frames in bookdown 1 Intro This is a minimal reproducible example related to this stackoverflow question. If new_session: no (the default) is set in the file _bookdown.yml, then data frames are printed with paging (the desired format). However, if we set new_session: yes, then paging is not applied. Any help on how to achieve paging under these circumstances is appreciated. "],

If new_session: no (the default) is set in the file _bookdown.yml, then data frames are printed with paging (the desired format). However, if we set new_session: yes, then paging is not applied. Any help on how to achieve paging under these circumstances is appreciated. 1.1 More detailed description of problem I am using bookdown to combine a number of Rmd files into a gitbook. Specifically, I want to use the “Knit and Merge” (K-M) approach, described here: Rmd files are knitted in separate R sessions, and merged afterwards. To do the K-M approach I have specified new_session: yes in the _bookdown.yml file. The opposite would be the “Merge and Knit” approach (M-K), where the Rmd files are first merged and then knitted in a common R session. For several reasons, I don’t want to use this approach. My problem: I would like data frames to be printed in paged format, but this does not seem to work using the K-M apprach. In case of the opposite M-K approach, this can be achieved by specifying df_print: paged in the YAML header of the index.Rmd file. My YAML header looks like this: --- title: &quot;My Book Title&quot; author: &quot;My Name&quot; site: bookdown::bookdown_site documentclass: book output: bookdown::gitbook: df_print: paged --- Where can/should I specify df_print: paged for bookdown’s K-M approach?
